# Covid-19-Simulation-Tools-CoSiT-
This project concerns the modeling and simulation in a multi-agent universe, of the impact of the barrier measures proposed by the WHO to fight against the spread of the new coronavirus Covid-19 (Corona Virus Disease 19). In this context, we have proposed a COSIT (Covid-19 Simulation Tools) IT tool, which can serve as a didactic support or be used to train and educate people and stakeholders on the importance of respecting barrier measures in the fight against the spread of the new Covid-19 coronavirus.


To load the software, you should install Gama software https://gama-platform.org/download. After that, download the zip file, create a model gama file and inport the downloaded folder CoSiT, and launch it.
